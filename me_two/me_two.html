        <h2>My Recent Gateaway</h2>
        <p>
            I have traveled to Tibet couple years ago, it was mesmerizing. I have visited the famous Potala Palace
            and seen how the monk practice their daily ritual. The scenery there is unlike anywhere else, the
            most challenging part has to be the altitude sickness, it is recommended to take specific medicine before
            heading into there.

        <h2>My Favorite Restaurant</h2>
        <p>
            <a href = "https://www.haidilao-inc.com/" target="_blank"> Hidilao</a> is my favorite restaurant, it is the best hotpot food chain.
            I can never get tired to eat the food they offered, because there are many combinations
            you can choose from the menu. Each soup base offers you different taste even when you eat the same item.
        </p>

                <p>
                    My favorite food has to be hotpot, I usuaully pick half spicy and half non-spicy 
                    soupbase since most of time you will be eating this with family or friends. 
                    I like to dip the meat and seafood first, so it gives the broth more taste to it. 
                    After the first couple rounds, I like to serve the veggies or noodle in the soup, 
                    which by then should have plenty of flavors.
